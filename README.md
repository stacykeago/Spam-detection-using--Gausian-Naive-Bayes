## Spam-detection-using--Gausian-Naive-Bayes

Experimental Procedure:
## Download the dataset from the given link:
* Dataset 2 Source: <[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase]>

Randomly partition each dataset into two parts i.e 80 - 20  sets.
* For dataset 2, perform classification of the testing set samples using the Naive Bayes Classifier.
* Compute the accuracy (percentage of correct classification).
* Report the confusion matrix of each classifier.
* Repeat step 2 to step 4 twice, each time splitting the datasets differently i.e. 70-30, 60-40, then note the outcomes of your modeling.
* Suggest and apply at least one of the optimization techniques that you learned earlier this week.
* Provide further recommendations to improve both classifiers.
